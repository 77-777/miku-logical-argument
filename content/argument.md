# Logical Argument

> On the possible inexistence of hell.

* The world is unfair and imperfect.
  * Humanity does not have equal capacity in cognitive processing.
    * There is struggle in the world.
      * There is disaster in the world.
        * There are multiple religions in the world.
          * There is time constraint and lack of accurate info.
            * Religion/God did not provide concrete, bullet-proof evidence on which religion is real or their existence.
              * Most religions claim there are no second chances to heaven because "life-span" is enough time to "realize your mistakes and fix them".

* Therefore it is absolutely unreasonable and nonsense for a God to judgementally and critically choose who goes to hell or who doesn't, especially without forgiveness or second chances.
* Considering he is, so claimed, to be good.
